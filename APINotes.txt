Server is CORS-enabled and the client and server can be deployed to different locations
IMPORTANT: Probably want to consider limiting CORS to a specific origin or whitelist (see cors module docs for how to do that)

npm install -g nodemon

To test easily locally:
open terminal
mongod    to start mongo
open another terminal
cd to server directory
node bin/www.js
open another terminal
cd to client directory
(install python if not already installed)
"c:\program files (x86)\python34\python" -m http.server 8888
On Mac, use python3 -m http.server 8888
open localhost:8888 in browser
