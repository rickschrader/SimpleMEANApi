The A in MEAN is typically Angular, but I'm stretching it to be Aurelia for this example

jspm cc (if problems with below)
jspm install -y
jspm dl-loader

http-server -o -c-1

Set specific versions (to the ones in the Aurelia starter kit) in the package.json for now, since pulling newer seems to cause major issues
